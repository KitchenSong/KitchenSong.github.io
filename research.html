<p><strong>@Nano Heat Group </strong>(Advisor: Prof. Nuo Yang)</p>
<p>In the research
on coupling between different phonon modes in graphene, doctoral candidate Meng An came up with
theory model and I built the simulation model to verify its validity. Then we discussed how to modify
the model based on simulation results. We did this feedback process time after time for months to
make sure we finally obtained an appropriate model that can rationally quantify coupling strength.</p>

<p><strong>@Nano Heat Group </strong>(Advisor: Prof. Nuo Yang)</p>
<p>I focused on finding ways to reduce thermal conductivity of graphene for its potential thermoelectric
application. Folding has been proved to be a useful way to manipulate the thermal conductivity
of graphene nanoribbon. However, given the fact that there exists a strong size effect on thermal
conductivity of graphene, the large-area folded graphene may be a different case and thus should
be investigated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> I applied my own FORTRAN program to set atom’s initial position,
  initial velocity distribution and atom reciprocal potentials explicitly and reasonably. To obtain the
  size-independent thermal conductivity characterizing large-area graphene, a series of simulation cases
  were calculated. Challenging was that computers cannot deal with some cases of extremely large
  simulation scale. I subtly optimized the code to accelerate the computing process and solved this
  issue successfully. And my results clearly show that thermal conductivity decreases significantly with
  increasing number of folds and stronger substrate effect, caused by the enhanced phonon scattering.
  This proves that even for large-area graphene with folds, folding still greatly contributes to reducing
  the thermal conductivity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, we are doing first principle calculation to invetigate the electric properties of the novel structures. Soon, this work wil be published.</p>
